# Portfolio
## Description

This is a Portfolio website thats responsive on all screens and has a few other features like animation and form validation. 

## Stack 
- PHP --> mail() php's emailing function, was mainly used for the contact form's validation. It also is responsible for the conformation message sent once a user submits the form.  
- JavaScript --> A few scripts were written for the navigation bars style and responsiveness, such as sticky scroll and the hamburger menu toggle.
- HTML & CSS --> Keyframes and transition eases is something I experimented with on this website.
